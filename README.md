# redding's site
Hi! i'm redding and I do a lot of things. This is my personal website, built using the eleventy SSG, liquid, and sass.

## TODOS:

- make a template for single artworks that links when you click on an image in the gallery
- make a blog post carousel and add one to art page

- projects page
    - take screenshots of all included projects
    - this one may be easier to just hardcode in html

- write a blog post or two
    - remove lipsum
- link to the rss feed somewhere

- restructure 'art.json' to 'pottery.json' or similar to allow different galleries for different media?

- restructuring/renaming/connecting to git
- deployment
