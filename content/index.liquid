<p>Hi! I'm redding. I'm a programmer, artist, and a student at Macalester College based in the Twin Cities, MN. I work in the media of fullstack, Unity (and more recently
  <a href="https://excaliburjs.com" target="blank">Excalibur</a>), ceramics, and printmaking.</p>

<p>In my free time I like to bike along the Mississippi, cook overcomplicated vegetarian meals, and get way too into the hot new indie game.</p>

<p>If you'd like to associate youself with some of the things I do, please check out my portfolio(s) or blog.</p>
